# Predator_Pray_Simulation
Simulation how prey and predators population behave in simulated environment. The goal was to find the parameters for prey and predators where their populations will stay in equilibrium. I wanted to stimulate the natural environment and see how those 2 cooexist. The simulation doesnt include food for prey. They multiply simply by existing while predators need to have food to multiply.
